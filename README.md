Technical Task:


1. URL Input Field and Image Display:
 Create an input field for a URL and a button. When the button is clicked, an image should appear in the center of the application using an HTML `< img >` element (not a Flutter `Image` widget).
 - Double-clicking on the image should toggle the browser's fullscreen mode. Use JS functions called directly from Dart for this functionality.

2. "Plus" Button and Context Menu:
 Add a button with a "Plus" icon to the bottom-right corner of the screen.
 - Clicking on this button should display a context menu with "Enter fullscreen" and "Exit fullscreen" buttons above it.
 - When the menu is open, the background should dim while the button and menu remain highlighted.
 - Clicking outside the menu should close it, and clicking the menu buttons should perform the corresponding action and close the menu.

3. Final Result:
 - Submit your code as a link to a GitHub repository.
 - Deploy the compiled web version of the application on GitHub Pages.
 - Ensure the code is formatted and documented according to the guidelines in 'Effective Dart' (https://dart.dev/effective-dart/documentation).
